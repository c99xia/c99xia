### üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I am a detail-oriented Computer Science Engineering student at the **Coimbra Engineering School (ISEC)**, specializing in Networks and Systems. My passion lies in designing, building, and securing the digital infrastructures that power our world.

### üîß My Hands-On Experience in Detail

#### üèóÔ∏è Physical Infrastructure & Structured Cabling
I believe that a robust network begins with a solid physical foundation. In a Structured Cabling course, I was responsible for designing a complex corporate network infrastructure from scratch.
* **Project:** Planning the network for a company with 3 multi-story buildings (3 floors each), strictly adhering to the **ISO/IEC 11801** standard.
* **Implementation:** The project involved designing the fiber optic backbone to interconnect the buildings, defining the horizontal copper twisted-pair cabling, and accurately calculating all necessary equipment: access and core switches, routers, and Access Points (APs) to ensure full coverage. This experience gave me a holistic view of network design.

#### üåê Routing Protocols & Essential Network Services
With the physical foundation established, I delved into the "brain" of the network: routing and services.
* **Advanced Routing:** I have hands-on experience configuring and diagnosing a wide range of routing protocols in both IPv4 and IPv6 environments using **GNS3**. This includes **RIP/RIPv2, EIGRP/EIGRPv6, OSPF/OSPFv3**, and implementing **static routing**, which is crucial for ISP connectivity scenarios.
* **Network Services:** In a practical environment that combined simulation in **Cisco Packet Tracer** with real implementation on virtual machines (**Windows 11 Client** and **Windows Server**), I configured and managed vital network services such as **DNS, DHCP, NTP, Proxy**, and **NAT**. This dual approach solidified my ability to translate theory into practice.

#### üõ°Ô∏è Network Security
My approach to security is fundamentally hands-on. In a cybersecurity-focused course, I participated in "Red Team vs. Blue Team" scenarios.
* **Attack Phase (Red Team):** Using **Kali Linux** VMs, I executed controlled attacks against a simulated corporate network in **GNS3**. Tools like **Nmap, Ettercap, Yersinia**, and **DHCPig** were used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
* **Defense Phase (Blue Team):** After understanding the attack vectors, my focus shifted to defense. I implemented **firewalls** and Layer 2 security mechanisms like **DHCP Snooping** and **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)** to mitigate and prevent the previously executed attacks. This experience gave me a complete perspective on the importance of a proactive defense.

#### üë®‚Äçüíª Beyond the Network: Systems Programming (Windows & Linux)
While my primary focus is on networks, my passion for technology has led me to explore low-level systems programming, where software meets hardware. This area has given me a fundamental understanding of concurrency, synchronization, and inter-process communication.

* **Concurrent Programming with the Win32 API (in C):** I developed a multi-threaded application (a word game) in a Windows environment. The main technical challenge was concurrency management. To overcome it, I implemented a wide range of synchronization primitives from the Win32 API, including:
    * **Threads** for parallel execution.
    * **Mutexes**, **Semaphores**, and **Critical Sections** to ensure mutual exclusion and protect shared resources from race conditions.
    * **Pipes** for secure inter-process communication.
    * Functions like **WaitForSingleObject** and **WaitForMultipleObjects** to orchestrate and synchronize the program's execution flow between threads.

* **Client-Server Architecture with the Linux API (in C):** In another significant project, I developed a client-server application in a Linux environment, capable of managing multiple client connections simultaneously. The key feature of this project was the implementation of a single-threaded concurrency model based on I/O multiplexing with the **`select()`** system call. This approach allowed the server to handle numerous clients efficiently without the overhead of creating a thread per client. For synchronization and communication, I used **pipes** and **mutexes**.

These two experiences, on both Windows and Linux, have given me a deep and practical understanding of different concurrency models and the complex challenges of systems programming.

* üöÄ **Professional Goal:** I am now focused on applying this comprehensive academic and practical foundation to an **internship or entry-level position** in Network Engineering, Systems Administration, or Cybersecurity. I am a natural problem-solver, a team player, and I am eager to contribute to challenging projects.
