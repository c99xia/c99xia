### üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I am a detail-oriented Computer Science Engineering student at the **Coimbra Engineering School (ISEC)**, specializing in Networks and Systems. My passion lies in designing, building, and securing the digital infrastructures that power our world.

*   üéì I'm currently pursuing my degree in **Computer Science Engineering**, where my coursework and labs have provided a strong foundation in network architecture and system administration.
*   üîß I thrive on the hands-on challenges of network management. My practical experience includes:
    *   Designing and testing complex network topologies in virtual environments using **GNS3** and **VMware**.
    *   Configuring and managing **Cisco IOS** on routers and switches.
    *   Implementing Layer 2 security features like **DHCP Snooping** and **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)**.
    *   Administering both **Linux** and **Windows Server** systems.
    *   Analyzing traffic and troubleshooting with **Wireshark**, and exploring network security on **Kali Linux** with tools like **Ettercap**.
*   üöÄ I am actively seeking an **internship or entry-level position** in Network Engineering, Systems Administration, or a related field where I can apply my problem-solving skills and continue to grow as a professional.
